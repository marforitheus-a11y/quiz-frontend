Concursando â€” Modern Preview

Files:
- index.html  (preview page)
- styles.css  (light/dark tokens)
- app.js      (theme toggle)
- logo.svg    (new logo)

How to preview locally:
1. Open `new-design/modern/index.html` in your browser (you can use Live Server extension in VSCode or just open the file).
2. Click Tema to toggle dark mode, and use the CTAs for simulated navigation.

Next steps to integrate with the real site:
- Convert layout to React components and use Tailwind/Tokens.
- Replace header/logo in `admin.html`, `quiz.html`, and `index.html` by copying the brand block.
- Migrate CSS variables into Tailwind's config or use a CSS variables layer.
